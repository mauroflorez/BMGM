Description: Provides a Bayesian approach for estimating 
    conditional independencies in mixed data, where variables can be continuous, 
    discrete, categorical, or zero-inflated count data. The model employs a 
    spike-and-slab prior for graph estimation and utilizes an MCMC algorithm
    for posterior inference. The package is particularly suited for applications 
    in healthcare, social sciences, and other fields involving mixed-type data, even 
    with missing observations.
