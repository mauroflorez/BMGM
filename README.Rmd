# BMGM: Bayesian Mixed Graphical Model 📊

BMGM (**Bayesian Mixed Graphical Model**) is an R package for **Bayesian inference on mixed graphical models**, allowing the estimation of **conditional independencies** between **continuous, discrete, categorical, and zero-inflated count** data. The package employs **MCMC sampling** and **spike-and-slab priors** for structure learning and can handle **missing data** during inference.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BMGM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mauroflorez/BMGM")
```

## Quick Start

```r
library(BMGM)

set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(200), ncol = 4)
type <- rep("c", 4)  # All continuous independent variables

fit <- bmgm(X, type, nburn = 500, nsample = 1000)
fit$adj_G
```

## 📖 Main Functions
- `bmgm()`: Fit the Bayesian Mixed Graphical Model  
- `find_lambda()`: Optimize transformation parameter (Arkaprava & Dunson, 2020) 
- `F_transformation()`: Apply transformation for mixed data
